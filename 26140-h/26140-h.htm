<h1>SECURITY</h1>

<p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%; font-size: 115%;"><i>If you let a man learn, and study, and work&mdash;and
clamp a lid on so that nothing he takes into his mind can
be let out&mdash;one way or another he'll blow a safety valve!</i></p>

<p class='tb'>Suddenly Collins snapped the pencil
between his fingers and hurled
the pieces across the lab, where they
clattered, rolled from the bench to
the floor, and were still. For a moment
he sat leaning against the desk,
his hands trembling. He wasn't sure
just when the last straw had been
added, but he was sure that he had
had enough. The restrictions, red
tape, security measures of these government
laboratories seemed to close
in on his mind in boiling, chaotic
waves of frustration. What was the
good of his work, all this great installation,
all the gleaming expensive
equipment in the lab around him?
He was alone. None of them seemed
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
to share his problem, the unctuous,
always correct Gordon, the easy-mannered,
unbearable Mason, all of
them gave him a feeling of actual
physical sickness.</p>

<p>Gardner's &ldquo;Nucleonics and Nuclear
Problems&rdquo; lay open on the desk
before him, but he looked instead
beyond through the clear curving
glass windows toward the sweep of
green hills and darkening sky and
the shadows of the lower forests that
gave Fair Oaks its name. Beside him
unfinished lay the summaries of the
day's experiments, and the unorganized,
hurriedly jotted notes for tomorrow's
work. The old intellectual
alertness was gone. Delight in
changing theory, in careful experimentation
no longer sprang from his
work and were a part of it. There
was a dull, indefinable aching in his
head and a dry, dissatisfied sensation
in his mouth.</p>

<p>Along the ordered walks below his
laboratory windows workers and
technicians streamed toward the
gates, checking out for the day
through the usual mass of red tape,
passes, and Geiger tests. Lights were
flicking on in the long East Wing
Dormitory across the quadrangle, and
the mess hall, where he had recently
eaten a tasteless supper, was lighted.</p>

<p>Shortly after restrictions had really
begun to tighten up last fall, he had
written to a worker who had published
making a minor correction in
his calculations and adding some suggestions
arising from his own research.
A week later his letter was
returned completely censored, stamped
&ldquo;Security-Violation.&rdquo; It was that
evasive Gordon's fault. He knew it,
but he couldn't prove it. Collins suspected
that the man was not a top-notch
researcher and so was in administration.
Perhaps Gordon was
jealous of his own work.</p>

<p>Even the Journals were drying up.
Endless innocuous papers recalculating
the values of harmless constants
and other such nonsense were all
that was being published. They were
hardly worth reading. Others were
feeling the throttling effects of security
measures, and isolated, lone
researchers were slowing down, listless
and anemic from the loss of the
life blood of science, the free interchange
of information.</p>

<p>The present research job he was
doing was coming slowly, but what
difference did it make? It would
never be published. Probably it
would be filed with a Department
of Defense code number as Research
Report DDNE-42 dash-dash-dash.
And there it would remain, top-secret,
guarded, unread, useless. Somewhere
in the desk drawers was the
directive worded in the stiff military
manner describing the procedures for
clearing papers for publication.
When he had first come here, he had
tried that.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, good, Collins,&rdquo; Gordon,
the Division Administrator, had said,
&ldquo;glad to check it over. Always happy
when one of our men has something
for publication. Gives the Division a
good name. I'll let you know, but we
have to be careful. Security you
know.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
Somehow he had never heard. The
first time he had made a pest of himself
with Gordon who was polite,
evasive, always plausible. Gordon,
Gordon&mdash;it was becoming an obsession
with him he knew, but the man
appeared at every turn. He personified
the system.</p>

<p>In the past months his work had
seemed to clog up in details and
slow down. The early days of broad,
rapid outlines and facile sketching in
of details were gone. Now the endless
indignities, invasion of personal
rights and freedom, the hamstringing
of his work, the feeling of being
cut off from the main currents of his
field, filled him with despair, anger,
and frustration.</p>

<hr />

<p class='tb'>Suddenly he raised his head,
slammed the notebook shut and
switched off the desk lamp. Not tonight.
Tomorrow would be time
enough to write out this stuff. He
needed a drink.</p>

<p>The hall was dark as he locked
the door to his lab except at the far
end near the stairway where a patch
of yellow light shone through an
open doorway. Mason, he thought,
Allan Mason, the one guy at Fair
Oaks Nuclear Energy Laboratories
who was always so damnedly cheerful,
who didn't seem to mind the
security restrictions, and who was
seen so often with Gordon. As he
walked rapidly past the open doorway,
he caught a flashing impression
from the corner of his eye of Mason's
tall figure bent over his bench,
his long legs wrapped around a lab
stool, the perpetual unlit pipe hanging
from the corner of his mouth.
Then as he swung quickly toward
the stairs, he heard Mason's cheerful
hail.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hi, Milt, hold up a sec.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Reluctantly he paused at the head
of the stairs scowling momentarily,
and then slowly turning and retraced
his steps.</p>

<p>The lab was brightly lighted, and
Mason stretched and smiled pleasantly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come in, old man, I'm about
ready to knock off for the evening.
How goes it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Collins mumbled an O.K. trying
to keep the irritation out of his voice,
and Mason went on.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just finishing up some loose ends
so I can get off to the Society meeting
on Monday. You going?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Shaking his head Collins felt his
dislike for this man growing. The
annual meeting of the North American
Society of Theoretical Physicists.
He didn't even give it any thought
any more. Maybe he could go, but it
didn't seem worth the effort. In the
past he had tried to go to the meetings,
but somehow work, rush work,
some change of emphasis had come
up on the project, and he had had
to cancel his plans. He'd finally given
up, but with Mason these things
seemed to come easily, and he wondered
<span style="white-space: nowrap;">why&mdash;</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;That's too bad&rdquo;&mdash;his voice
droned pleasantly on, and Collins'
eye caught several botany texts in
the book rack above Mason's desk.
So, he had time to read stuff outside
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
of his field. His work was going
well. He had time for meetings and
was allowed to go to them&mdash;the anger
rose slowly like a swelling bubble
from the hard core of his stomach.
Then he realized that Mason had
stopped talking and was looking at
him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Milt, you look glum tonight. Is
there&mdash; Why not have supper with
me, and we'll take in the movie in
the lounge?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I've eaten already.&rdquo; Collins was
on his feet. He forced a, &ldquo;Thanks
anyway. See you tomorrow. <span style="white-space: nowrap;">I'm&mdash;&rdquo;</span>
and he was gone.</p>

<p>As he strode angerly across the
quadrangle Mason's words and cheerful
attitude rankled in his mind.
The gravel of the walk spurted from
under his shoes, and the night air
was clear and cool. It was good at
least to feel something other than
despair again, even anger.</p>

<p>But once in his study with its attached
bedroom and bath that made
up his living quarters, he sank to the
couch near his desk, all of the fight
gone. He needed a drink. Today all
the irritations, tensions, and suspicions
of the past months seemed to
close in on him. His work was going
badly. Perhaps seeing Mason had
brought it to a head. The fifth of
bourbon in the bottom desk drawer
was partly gone from the party last
month. He took a swallow neat, and
the fire of the liquid burned and
clawed its way down his throat and
spread with blossoming warmth in
his stomach.</p>

<p>Kicking off his shoes and loosening
his tie he leaned back with the
bottle on the floor beside him.</p>

<p>Later in the evening when the
early clarity of thought had left him
and his mind moved disjointedly in
and out of seemingly brilliant, emotional
solutions to his problem, he
knew he must have a showdown. Lying
back on the couch he drifted into
sleep determined to have it out with
Gordon in the morning&mdash;resign if
necessary.</p>

<hr />

<p class='tb'>The momentary pause of lighting
his cigarette gave Collins a chance
to decide where to start, as he sat
across from Gordon. The Division
Administrator was older with a
heavy-jowled, close shaven face, and
he waited patiently for Collins to
speak.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dr. Gordon, I am having a great
deal of difficulty in making an adjustment
both in my work and in my
personal relations here at Fair Oaks,
and last night I realized that I would
have to talk to you about it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Gordon's face changed slightly,
his eyebrows rising almost imperceptibly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So, what &hellip; how do you mean,
Milt?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Use of the first name&mdash;the familiar
approach thought Collins&mdash;administrative
technique number
blank blank dash blank.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dr. Gordon, these security measures
we are under, the difficulty of
publishing, of getting to scientific
meetings, the problem of getting
furloughs, lack of knowledge of
what is going on in my own field,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
it's just a little too much. It's personally
irritating, but it greatly
hampers my work as well. Frankly,
I'm against the entire security program
as it now stands. If it isn't
stopped research will &hellip; well, simply
be impossible. Free interchange of
information is essential <span style="white-space: nowrap;">to&mdash;&rdquo;</span> His
fingers were gripping the arms of his
chair.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, of course, Milt, but corny
as it sounds there is a war on you
know. Oh, not a war with military
weapons&mdash;yet, but a cold war of science
and engineering, a struggle for
supremacy in many fields of knowledge.
If information of our work
leaks out, gets to the enemy, we
might as well not do that work. We
can't be too careful.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I agree, but it goes too far.&rdquo; He
leaned forward. &ldquo;My private mail is
read, and on my last furlough I am
certain I was watched from the time
I left the gates out there until I returned,
and I don't like it. I can't
prove it, but&mdash; That's getting to the
point that life's not worth while.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come now, Milt, don't you think
you're taking this a little too seriously?
You're getting stale, overwrought.
You need a fresh point of
view. Lots of our people feel as you
do at one time or another, but most
of us learn to live with these necessary
regulations, and do our work in
spite of them. Let me make a suggestion,
relax, take a little time off,
develop a hobby. Why not do some
reading in a field of science other
than your own. It's good for you.
Several of the people here are doing
it. I do it, Carter, even Mason for
<span style="white-space: nowrap;">instance&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p>

<p>Collins could feel the anger rising
in him again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look, Gordon, I'm not going to
mince words. I'm sick and tired of
this mess, and you might as well
know it. You can have all your damn
relaxations and hobbies, or what have
you. I want to do my work, and if
I can't do it here, I'm going somewhere
where I can do it. In plain
English unless we can have an understanding
right now&mdash;I resign.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It had come out, and Collins was
breathing hard, but Gordon's expression
hardly changed as he looked
over the tips of his joined fingers,
while the younger man stopped and
crushed out his cigarette viciously in
the ash disposer on the arm of his
chair. Gordon doodled on a small
pad for a moment, his eyes not meeting
Collins'. Then he spoke
slowly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I'm sorry you feel that way, Milt.
I &hellip; I'm afraid I cannot accept your
resignation. You see,&rdquo; he said softly,
&ldquo;none of us can leave Fair Oaks&mdash;now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Collins looked up, amazement and
incredulity written on his face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you mean&mdash;can't leave?
I can leave any <span style="white-space: nowrap;">time&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p>

<p>Gordon slowly shook his head almost
sadly. &ldquo;No, only assistants,
technicians, maintenance people, and
they are carefully watched or restricted
to this area. People like yourself,
like me, we have information,
knowledge which cannot be let out
of government hands at this time.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
We're here probably for the &lsquo;duration&rsquo;;
maybe longer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But&mdash;this is barbarous. <span style="white-space: nowrap;">I&mdash;&rdquo;</span> the
words clogged, jumbled as he tried
to get them out. His emotions ran
from anger, to amazement, to indignation,
followed by a trickle of fear,
and as he stared at Gordon, the fear
grew. He could scarcely hear Gordon's
<span style="white-space: nowrap;">words&mdash;</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Take my advice&mdash;relax&mdash;and forget
your fears&mdash;accept the restrictions
and go ahead&mdash;read in some
other field&mdash;come in again when
you've thought it out.&rdquo; He was
scarcely aware when Gordon slipped
a bound journal volume into his
hands and walked with him to the
door&mdash;and closed it behind him.</p>

<hr />

<p class='tb'>Collins left Gordon's office in Administration
moving slowly, one arm
hanging loosely by his side, the other
clutching the book. The corridor
stretched ahead into B Wing with
its laboratories flooded with the glow
of mid-morning sunshine, bright and
unreal. His mind was dazed, his
thinking processes stopped in a kind
of stunned unbelief. He could not
even quit now. An undercurrent of
fear ran close to the surface of his
confused mind. It was the end of
science, the end of all his work. All
of the stifling, strangling restrictions
of security on his work, on his private
life, came whirling back as a
monstrous, formless threat, something
unspeakably big and powerful
and unbeatable against which he
could not fight.</p>

<p>To his right as he moved slowly
down the hall the double doors of
the main library reading room were
open with the stacks and study
cubicles beyond, silent and restful.
He paused and then entered crossing
into the maze of the stacks through
a grilled iron doorway. The important
thing now was not to meet anyone,
not to have to speak or smile or
think. It was very important now to
be alone and quiet.</p>

<p>He walked until he found an
empty cubicle, the endless walls of
books, repositories of knowledge, silent
and reproachful around him.
Knowledge and books such as these
would soon be added to no longer.
He slumped into the chair and gazed
at the tiny reading desk with its softly
glowing lamp and the small stack
of volumes on the rack left by previous
users. Absently he stared for a
long time at the volume Gordon had
given him as if seeing it for the
first time. Then with a deliberate
effort he opened it and thumbed
through slowly only half seeing its
pages. <cite>The Journal of Botanical Research.</cite></p>

<p>The pages in the <cite>Journal</cite> were like
a look through an open window.
Outside of classified projects in
&ldquo;harmless&rdquo; fields of research the
work of science went on, papers were
published, reputations were made,
freedom still existed. He remembered
Gordon's sleek smile and advice
to relax and read in other fields.
This stupid useless advice still rankled.
Of course, he probably was
stale, but to read junk like this!</p>

<p>Silently and in his mind, he cursed
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
the day he had studied physics, better
archeology or zoology, anything.
Suddenly he stopped riffling the
pages and leaned forward, rapidly
turning back to something that had
caught his eye. It was a three and
one-half page paper on &ldquo;The Statistical
Probability of Chromosome
Crossover&rdquo; written in neat sections
with several charts and references. It
was by M. Mason.</p>

<p>Something clicked in Collins'
mind&mdash;read the journals&mdash;Mason's
unconcern with security, the botany
books on his desk the night before.
It didn't make sense, but it added
up to something. Mason knew something
and so did Gordon. He half
rose. He had to get to the bottom
of it. Clutching the bound <cite>Journal</cite>
Collins turned and weaved through
the stacks and out of the library waving
the protesting librarian aside and
strode down the corridor toward the
laboratories.</p>

<hr />

<p class='tb'>The door to Mason's lab was partially
open, and he looked up quizzically
from taking an instrument
reading as Collins burst in.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mason, <span style="white-space: nowrap;">I&mdash;&rdquo;</span> he planked the
bound volume of the <cite>Botanical Journal</cite>
on the lab bench beside the instrument
ignoring Mason's wince as
the instrument needle quivered with
the jar. &ldquo;Did you write this?&rdquo; His
finger jabbed at the open page.</p>

<p>Mason glanced at Collins, removed
a pair of glasses from his white lab
coat pocket, and putting them on
leaned forward and studied the page
for a moment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. Not bad either though I
shouldn't say it. I didn't know you
were interested in Botany.&rdquo; His
voice was casual with a slight questioning
note.</p>

<p>Collins suddenly felt ridiculous.
What was he accusing the man of?
Mason had a right to publish on
anything he wanted to, still a muddled
series of half facts, incidents
and suspicions chased through his
mind.</p>

<p>Mason walked over to his desk
and filling his pipe sat down
thoughtfully and leaned back motioning
Collins into a nearby chair.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think I know what is on your
mind, Milt. Maybe I can straighten
this out. Gordon told me a little
while ago that you wanted to resign.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Collins stiffened. So, these two
were working together.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Milt, did you ever stop to think
how lucky we are? Where can you
get better equipment, help, coöperation
in the country than here?&rdquo; Collins
leaned forward to speak, but
Mason went on. &ldquo;Oh, I know all the
problems of security and how it
strangles work.&rdquo; He paused for a
moment as though trying to grasp
the right words.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look, Milt, what's the basic
problem? Why do security measures
strangle research? Isn't it a matter
basically of a breakdown in the interchange
of ideas? Sure, and it has
come about because there has been
no method of communication which
would not get to and be used by our
enemies. So, like yourself, I'm forbidden
to publish the results of my
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
work here in the journals. Why? Because
those results are in my field
of study, chain reactions.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I'm frustrated just as you have
been and science suffers. What do I
do? I write articles in a field that
isn't restricted, botany. It's a new
field of interest to me, a hobby if
you like. The stuff is published and
gets wide distribution. Every decent
library in the country gets it. Every
scientist all over the country can read
the papers if he cares to. Then the
word gets around, by the scientific
grapevine, with a little judicious ear-bending.
I get a reputation&mdash;in
Botany.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now the botanists know that I
am not a botanist. They understand
what I am doing. The word spreads,
and they leave my stuff alone. The
physicists in my specialty know my
name, and they get the word, and
pretty soon they are glancing over
certain botany journals apparently
for relaxation. They read my papers.
It's slow, but it works.&rdquo; Mason
leaned forward and struck a large
stick match under the lab bench top.
Drawing several puffs through his
pipe his eyes were on Collins' confused
face. Then he laid the pipe
down.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The enemy botanists may read
the botany journals, sure, but the
enemy physicists don't. Their totalitarian
training has made them inflexible
in their thinking, besides they
have their hands full trying to keep
up in their own fields. The curse of
specialization is a blessing to us.
When the enemy botanists read it, it
makes sense, but it doesn't help them
much in their work&mdash;more or less
innocuous.&rdquo; He waved toward the
botany texts on his desk. &ldquo;It took me
six months to learn enough about it
to do the job.&rdquo; As he spoke Mason
untangled his legs and brought the
open journal over to his desk.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right, notice in my article I
am writing on chromosomes&mdash;chains
of genes, and my field <span style="white-space: nowrap;">is&mdash;?&rdquo;</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Chain reactions,&rdquo; Collins finished
softly, <span style="white-space: nowrap;">&ldquo;but&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;The article itself is well disguised,
but it's a parable. It's botany
on the surface, but it gets over
enough chain-reaction theory to be
good physics, if you read it right.
You see botany is what you might
call my code field.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The bright light of noon shimmered
on the white buildings and
green lawns beyond the lab windows.
Collins was silent and thoughtful.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, that's about all. Gordon
knows. He's in with us, but the Government
doesn't suspect&mdash;yet. Oh,
they may catch on to us. Information
may leak out to the enemy. There's
some chance, but when we're caught
we'll think of something else. Most
of us believe it's worth the chance.
There's a risk in anything.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Suddenly all the pieces fell into
place, and Collins' anger and confusion
melted away. In its place was a
sense of relief and hope, hope for
the future. It wasn't the final answer,
but it was a way to keep going. He
was not alone any longer. He had
